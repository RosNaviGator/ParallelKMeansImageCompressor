This project implements a {\bfseries{parallel KMeans-\/based image colors compressor}}, aimed at reducing the number of colors in a natural image while preserving its overall visual appearance. The program clusters similar colors using the {\bfseries{KMeans algorithm}} and applies {\bfseries{parallel computing techniques}} to compress the image through the {\bfseries{color quantization}} technique. It supports {\bfseries{sequential}}, {\bfseries{Open\+MP}}, {\bfseries{MPI}}, and {\bfseries{CUDA}} implementations to explore different levels of performance and scalability.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Authors}{Authors}}\label{index_autotoc_md1}

If you choose the "{}\+Compress an image"{} option you will be asked to select\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Type of parallelization}} among {\itshape sequential}, {\itshape MPI}, {\itshape Open\+MP} (also CUDA if {\ttfamily nvcc} was used during the compiling process), the type of compression, and the path of the original image.
\item {\bfseries{Color level}}\+: five levels of compression, each corresponding to a certain {\itshape percentage of retained colors} (it\textquotesingle{}s possible to visualize such percentages in the {\ttfamily .config} file).
\item {\bfseries{Image path}}\+: The location of the original image file to be compressed.
\item {\bfseries{Three methods of compression}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Light Compression}}\+: Preserves the most detail, recommended for smaller images where maintaining high quality is a priority. This level may take more time to process.
\item {\bfseries{Medium Compression}}\+: Uses chroma subsampling to reduce image size and processing time. This is a balanced option for moderate size reduction while retaining good image quality.
\item {\bfseries{Heavy Compression}}\+: Applies both chroma subsampling and resizing, significantly reducing the image size. Suitable for larger images where file size reduction is more important than retaining the highest possible quality.

The menu will launch the {\ttfamily decoder} {\itshape process} (again with {\ttfamily boost/process}), there you will be asked to choose which {\ttfamily .kc} (\textquotesingle{}kmeans-\/compressed\textquotesingle{}) to decode and visualize. Program creates list of {\ttfamily .kc} available to decode from the {\ttfamily output} folder.

KMeans is a widely used clustering technique that partitions data into a given number K of clusters. In the context of image {\bfseries{compression}} KMeans is employed to reduce the color palette by grouping similar colors ({\bfseries{color quantization}}), possibly minimizing the data required to represent the image.

  \hypertarget{index_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Kmeans}{Kmeans}}\label{index_autotoc_md28}
The algorithm begins with an initialization phase, where \$k\$ initial cluster centers (means) \$\textbackslash{}mu\+\_\+1\texorpdfstring{$^\wedge$}{\string^}0, \textbackslash{}mu\+\_\+2\texorpdfstring{$^\wedge$}{\string^}0, \textbackslash{}ldots, \textbackslash{}mu\+\_\+k\texorpdfstring{$^\wedge$}{\string^}0\$ are chosen. After initialization, the algorithm enters an iterative phase, often referred to as {\bfseries{Lloyd’s algorithm}}, which repeatedly executes two main steps until convergence is reached.
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
\item Recompute the centroids based on the data points assigned to them.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

It is important to note that {\bfseries{K-\/means-\/based compression}} is a form of {\bfseries{lossy compression}}. Unlike lossless compression techniques, where the original data can be perfectly reconstructed,lossy compression involves some level of data loss. In the context of K-\/means, each pixel\textquotesingle{}s color is approximated by the nearest centroid among the \$k\$ chosen colors. This approximation inevitably leads to a loss of some color information, making the {\bfseries{compression irreversible}}. The degree of perceptible data loss is often minimal when the number of clusters \$k\$ is adequately chosen, but it can become noticeable if \$k\$ is too low, resulting in a more significant approximation error\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Parallelization Techniques}{Parallelization Techniques}}\label{index_autotoc_md29}
The program uses several parallelization techniques to enhance performance. These techniques include\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Open\+MP}}\+: Open\+MP is an API for parallel programming on shared-\/memory systems. It allows the program to parallelize the computation of the k-\/means algorithm by distributing the work among multiple threads.
\item {\bfseries{MPI}}\+: MPI is a message-\/passing library for parallel programming on distributed-\/memory systems. It allows the program to parallelize the computation of the k-\/means algorithm by distributing the work among multiple processes running on different nodes.
\item {\bfseries{CUDA}}\+: is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general-\/purpose computing on GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). CUDA enables the acceleration of computationally intensive algorithms, like k-\/means clustering, by offloading the work to GPUs, which can process thousands of threads simultaneously. This results in a significant speedup, especially for tasks that involve large datasets and require high computational throughput.
