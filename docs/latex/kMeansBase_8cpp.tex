\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Base class implementation for the K-\/means clustering algorithm. 

This file contains the implementation of the {\ttfamily KMeans\+Base} class, which serves as the base class for different versions of the K-\/means clustering algorithm. It provides fundamental functionalities such as initialization of centroids, getters for points, centroids, and the number of iterations.
