\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
MPI implementation of the K-\/means clustering algorithm. 

This file contains the implementation of the {\ttfamily KMeans\+MPI} class, which uses MPI (Message Passing Interface) for parallel processing to perform the K-\/means clustering algorithm across multiple processors. The class handles tasks such as initializing centroids, distributing data, computing new centroids, and synchronizing results among different MPI processes. This implementation is designed for efficient distributed computation in a high-\/performance computing environment.
