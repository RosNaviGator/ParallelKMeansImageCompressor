\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Open\+MP implementation of the K-\/means clustering algorithm. 

This file contains the implementation of the {\ttfamily KMeans\+OMP} class, which utilizes Open\+MP for parallel processing to perform the K-\/means clustering algorithm using multiple threads. The class includes methods for initializing centroids, updating cluster assignments, recalculating centroids, and synchronizing results across threads. This implementation leverages multi-\/threading to enhance performance in shared-\/memory environments.
