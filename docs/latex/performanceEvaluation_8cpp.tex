\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Utility functions for evaluating and recording the performance of image compression algorithms. 

This file contains the implementation of the {\ttfamily Performance} class, which provides functionalities to record performance metrics such as time taken for compression, number of iterations, and other relevant statistics. The class includes methods to fill performance data, write results to a CSV file, and manage the creation and appending of data to the CSV file for easy analysis.
