\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the Point class for image compression algorithms. 

This file contains the implementation of the {\ttfamily Point} class, which represents a pixel or data point in a color space for use in image compression algorithms. The class provides methods to access and modify color features, calculate distances between points, and manage cluster assignments. It is a core component for K-\/means clustering and similar algorithms.
